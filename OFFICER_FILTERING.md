# Officer-Specific Case Filtering

## Overview
The Case Management system now implements officer-specific filtering to ensure that each logged-in officer only sees cases assigned to them.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Authentication Integration
- Uses `useAuth()` hook to get current logged-in officer information
- Extracts officer name from `user.fullName` or `user.email` (fallback)
- User authentication provides role-based access control

### 2. Database Layer Updates
**Firestore Service (`firestoreService.ts`)**
- Added `loadCasesByOfficer(officerName: string)` method
- Filters Firestore queries using `where('officer_assigned', '==', officerName)`
- Maintains existing `loadAllCases()` for admin/supervisory roles

**Data Layer (`firData.ts`)**
- Modified `loadFIRData(officerName?: string)` to accept optional officer parameter
- Automatically filters cases when officer name is provided
- Fallback to JSON files also respects officer filtering

### 3. UI Components
**Case Management (`CaseManagement.tsx`)**
- Automatically loads only cases assigned to current officer
- Updated header to show which officer's cases are displayed
- Modified transfer functionality to remove transferred cases from current officer's view
- Enhanced empty state messages for officer-specific context

**Transfer Case Modal (`TransferCaseModal.tsx`)**
- Shows current officer information in transfer details
- Logs transfer history with proper audit trail
- Removes case from current officer's list after successful transfer

## Features

### 1. Officer-Specific Case Loading
```typescript
// Only loads cases assigned to current officer
const currentOfficer = user?.fullName || user?.email?.split('@')[0];
const firCases = await loadFIRData(currentOfficer);
```

### 2. Case Transfer
- When an officer transfers a case, it's removed from their case list
- Transfer is logged with full audit trail including reason and timestamp
- Receiving officer will see the case in their dashboard

### 3. Security & Privacy
- Officers can only view cases assigned to them
- No access to cases assigned to other officers
- Admin/supervisory roles can still view all cases if needed

## Database Schema

### FIR Document Structure
```json
{
  "fir_number": "FIR2024001",
  "officer_assigned": "Officer Singh",
  "victim_full_name": "John Doe",
  "incident_type": "Theft",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Transfer Log Structure
```json
{
  "caseId": "FIR2024001",
  "fromOfficer": "Officer Singh",
  "toOfficer": "Officer Patel",
  "reason": "Case reassignment due to workload",
  "transferredAt": "2025-09-20T10:30:00Z",
  "transferredBy": "Officer Singh",
  "caseType": "Theft"
}
```

## Usage

### For Officers
1. Login with officer credentials
2. Navigate to Case Management
3. See only cases assigned to you
4. Transfer cases using the transfer button
5. Cases disappear from your list after transfer

### For Administrators
- Can implement admin dashboard to view all cases
- Access to transfer logs and audit trails
- Ability to reassign cases between officers

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Officer Login**: Verify only assigned cases are displayed
2. **Case Transfer**: Confirm case moves between officers correctly
3. **Empty State**: Check behavior when officer has no assigned cases
4. **Fallback**: Ensure JSON fallback also respects officer filtering

### Verification Steps
1. Login as different officers
2. Verify case lists are different for each officer
3. Transfer a case and confirm it moves correctly
4. Check Firestore collections for proper data structure

## Future Enhancements

1. **Supervisor Dashboard**: View all officer cases with assignment capabilities
2. **Case Load Balancing**: Automatic case distribution based on workload
3. **Officer Performance Metrics**: Track case resolution rates per officer
4. **Mobile Officer App**: Field officers can update cases on mobile devices
5. **Real-time Notifications**: Notify officers of new case assignments

## Technical Notes

- Uses Firestore `where()` queries for efficient filtering
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing data
- Graceful fallback to JSON files when Firestore is unavailable
- TypeScript types ensure type safety throughout the application
