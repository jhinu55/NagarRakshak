# Case Deletion Feature Documentation

## Overview
The case deletion feature allows authorized police officers to permanently delete cases from the NagarRakshak system. This feature includes proper safeguards, audit logging, and confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. 🛡️ **Secure Delete Process**
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Officers must confirm their intention to delete
- **Reason Requirement**: A detailed reason (minimum 10 characters) is mandatory
- **No Accidental Deletions**: Multiple confirmation steps prevent mistakes

### 2. 📝 **Audit Trail**
- **Complete Logging**: Every deletion is logged with full details
- **Officer Attribution**: Tracks which officer performed the deletion
- **Timestamp Recording**: Exact time of deletion is recorded
- **Reason Documentation**: The provided reason is permanently stored

### 3. 🎯 **User Experience**
- **Professional UI**: Clean, intuitive deletion workflow
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during the deletion process
- **Success/Error Messages**: Immediate feedback on operation status
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

## How to Use

### For Users (Police Officers)
1. **Navigate to Case Management** page
2. **Find the case** you want to delete using search or filters
3. **Click the Delete button** (🗑️ trash icon) in either grid or list view
4. **Review case details** in the confirmation modal
5. **Enter a detailed reason** for the deletion (minimum 10 characters)
6. **Click "Delete Case"** to confirm
7. **View success message** confirming the deletion

### For Developers

#### Frontend Components
- `DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx` - The main deletion confirmation UI
- `CaseManagement.tsx` - Integrated delete functionality
- `firData.ts` - Delete utility functions
- `mockAPI.ts` - Mock backend API simulation

#### Backend Script
```bash
# Delete a case using the command line script
node scripts/deleteCase.js NR-2025-00001 "Case resolved and no longer needed"
```

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Flow
1. User clicks delete button → `handleDeleteClick()`
2. Confirmation modal opens with case details
3. User enters reason and confirms → `handleDeleteConfirm()`
4. API call to delete case → `deleteCase()`
5. Local state updated (case removed from UI)
6. Success message displayed

### Backend Integration
```typescript
// Example API integration
const response = await fetch(`/api/cases/${caseId}`, {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ reason, fileName })
});
```

### Audit Logging
```typescript
interface AuditLog {
  caseId: string;
  fileName: string;
  reason: string;
  deletedBy: string;
  deletedAt: string;
  ipAddress?: string;
  userAgent?: string;
}
```

logs/
└── deletion_*.json                  # Audit logs (created automatically)
```

## Security Features

### 1. **Confirmation Requirements**
- Visual warning about permanent deletion
- Mandatory reason field with minimum length
- Case details display for verification
- Multiple confirmation steps

### 2. **Audit Trail**
- Complete deletion logs stored in `logs/` folder
- Includes officer ID, timestamp, reason, and file details
- Cannot be bypassed or disabled
- Permanent record for compliance

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Graceful handling of network errors
- Validation of reason field
- Prevention of duplicate deletions
- Clear error messages to users

## Production Considerations

### 1. **Authentication**
- Implement proper officer authentication
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- JWT token verification

### 2. **Database Integration**
- Replace file-based storage with database
- Soft delete vs hard delete options
- Backup before deletion
- Referential integrity checks

### 3. **Audit Compliance**
- Legal requirement compliance
- Backup audit logs
- Tamper-proof logging
- Regular audit reports

## Example Usage

### Successful Deletion Flow
1. Officer clicks delete on case "NR-2025-00001"
2. Modal shows: "Theft case by Rajesh Kumar"
3. Officer enters: "Case resolved, stolen item recovered and returned to owner"
4. System logs deletion with full audit trail
5. Case removed from UI with success message
6. File deleted from server (in production)

### Error Scenarios
- **Short reason**: "Reason must be at least 10 characters long"
- **Network error**: "Failed to delete case. Please try again."
- **File not found**: "Case file not found"
- **Permission denied**: "You don't have permission to delete this case"

## Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. ✅ Delete with valid reason (>10 characters)
2. ✅ Delete with invalid reason (<10 characters) 
3. ✅ Cancel deletion process
4. ✅ Delete multiple cases in sequence
5. ✅ Delete during network issues
6. ✅ Verify audit logs are created
7. ✅ Verify UI updates correctly

### Command Line Testing
```bash
# Test the deletion script
node scripts/deleteCase.js NR-2025-00001 "Test deletion for development"

# View audit logs
ls -la logs/
cat logs/deletion_NR-2025-00001_*.json
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Deletion**: Select and delete multiple cases at once
2. **Deletion Approval**: Require supervisor approval for sensitive cases
3. **Restore Functionality**: Implement soft delete with restore option
4. **Advanced Audit**: Include before/after snapshots
5. **Email Notifications**: Notify stakeholders of case deletions
6. **Deletion Scheduling**: Schedule deletions for specific times

## Support

For technical issues or questions about the deletion feature:
- Check the browser console for error logs
- Review audit logs in the `logs/` folder  
- Verify case file exists in `public/data/`
