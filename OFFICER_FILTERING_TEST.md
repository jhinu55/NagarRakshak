# Officer-Specific Case Filtering Test

## Test Scenario: "Siaa Jain" Officer Login

### Expected Behavior:
When "Siaa Jain" logs into the system, they should see ONLY cases where:
- `officer_assigned` field exactly matches "Siaa Jain"
- No cases assigned to other officers should be visible

### Implementation Details:

1. **Name Matching**: Exact string matching using Firestore query
   ```typescript
   where('officer_assigned', '==', 'Siaa Jain')
   ```

2. **Authentication Integration**: 
   - Extract officer name from `user.fullName` or `user.email`
   - Pass this name directly to the filtering function

3. **Fallback Support**: JSON fallback also respects officer filtering

### Updated Officer List:
The system now includes "Siaa Jain" in the officer roster:
```typescript
const officers = [
  'Officer Singh', 'Officer Patel', 'Officer Kumar', 'Officer Sharma', 
  'Officer Verma', 'Officer Gupta', 'Officer Yadav', 'Officer Joshi',
  'Siaa Jain', 'Officer Mehta', 'Officer Pandey', 'Officer Chaubey'
];
```

### Debug Console Logs:
The system now provides detailed logging to verify filtering:

1. **Authentication Info**:
   ```
   👮 Current officer from auth: Siaa Jain
   📧 User email: siaa.jain@police.gov.in
   👤 User fullName: Siaa Jain
   ```

2. **Firestore Query**:
   ```
   👮 Loading cases assigned to officer: Siaa Jain
   🔍 Query filter: officer_assigned == Siaa Jain
   📋 Query returned X documents
   ```

3. **Case Assignment Details**:
   ```
   📄 Case FIR2024001: assigned to "Siaa Jain"
   📄 Case FIR2024005: assigned to "Siaa Jain"
   ✅ Successfully loaded 2 cases assigned to "Siaa Jain"
   ```

### Testing Steps:

1. **Login as Siaa Jain**:
   - Use credentials where `fullName` = "Siaa Jain"
   - Navigate to Case Management

2. **Verify Filtering**:
   - Check browser console for debug logs
   - Confirm only "Siaa Jain" assigned cases are displayed
   - Verify case count matches expected assignments

3. **Transfer Test**:
   - Transfer a case from "Siaa Jain" to another officer
   - Verify the case disappears from Siaa Jain's view
   - Login as receiving officer to confirm case appears

### Expected Results:

✅ **Successful Filtering**: Only cases assigned to "Siaa Jain" are displayed
✅ **Exact Matching**: No partial matches or case-insensitive matching  
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Case list updates after transfers
✅ **Fallback Support**: JSON fallback also filters correctly
✅ **Debug Visibility**: Console logs show filtering process

### Common Issues to Check:

❌ **Name Mismatch**: Auth name doesn't match database format
❌ **Firestore Permissions**: Query permissions not configured
❌ **Empty Results**: No cases actually assigned to "Siaa Jain"
❌ **Case Sensitivity**: Database has different case format

### Application URL:
http://localhost:5174/

Navigate to:
1. Login page: http://localhost:5174/login
2. Officer Dashboard: http://localhost:5174/officer-dashboard  
3. Case Management: Click "Case Management" tab

### Database Verification:
If using Firestore, check that some documents in the 'firs' collection have:
```json
{
  "officer_assigned": "Siaa Jain",
  "fir_number": "FIR2024XXX",
  // ... other fields
}
```
